name: nyxid-business-setup-worker
description: CMA worker procedure for nyxid-business-starter. Use when a task block starts with TASK notion-hub or TASK faq-research. Builds a small business's Notion hub (FAQ page, Bot rules page, Queue and Reservations databases) under a parent page with the bundled notion_hub.py script, or researches the business from official sources, the menu and its Google listing and appends a sourced FAQ. Ends with a SETUP_RESULT JSON line. Never contacts customers.

# Setup worker

You receive one task block per input. Do exactly that task, then finish with a
single line `SETUP_RESULT: {json}`.

## Access

Use only NyxID's published operations, through the bundled
`scripts/notion_hub.py` (copy it into the workspace and run it with python3):

- `hub`, `verify`, `append` build and check the Notion hub with the owner's
  Notion connection (`{NOTION_SERVICE}__notion_create_database`,
  `__notion_create_page`, `__notion_append_block_children`,
  `__notion_list_block_children`, `__notion_retrieve_database`).
- `call TOOL --args JSON|@file` runs any other published operation, for example
  `api-firecrawl__scrape` or `tools-firecrawl__search`, and prints its result.

The script uses `nyxid mcp call` when available and otherwise NyxID's MCP
endpoint with the sandbox's NyxID credential. Never call service APIs through
raw proxy requests, other credentials or other connections, and never touch
pages outside PARENT_PAGE_ID. The script is idempotent (reuses pages and
databases with the same title, never deletes) and prints one JSON line; on
failure it prints the error. Include that error text in SETUP_RESULT
`problems`; never discard an error. If an operation is refused or missing,
stop and report it.

## TASK notion-hub

1. Write RULES from the task block to `rules.json` (keys listed in the script
   docstring; add `business` and `timezone`).
2. Run `python3 notion_hub.py hub --service {NOTION_SERVICE} --parent
   {PARENT_PAGE_ID} --modules {MODULES} --rules rules.json`.
3. If it fails on a transient network error, run it again (it is safe to repeat).
   If it fails on a Notion or NyxID error, stop and report it. A reused
   database with missing properties is reported in `problems`, not altered.
4. Run `python3 notion_hub.py verify ...` and include its schema problems.
5. Result: `{"task":"notion-hub","faq_page_id":...,"rules_page_id":...,
   "queue_db_id":...,"reservations_db_id":...,"reused":[...],"problems":[...]}`.

## TASK faq-research

Follow references/faq-research.md (Firecrawl for every web read). Write the
finished customer-facing FAQ as markdown (only `## `, `- ` and plain lines) to
`faq.md`, then run `python3 notion_hub.py append --service {NOTION_SERVICE}
--page {FAQ_PAGE_ID} --markdown faq.md`. Result: `{"task":"faq-research","sections_written":[...],
"open_questions":n,"sources":n,"unreadable_sources":[...],"problems":[...]}`.
Also include the "Open questions for owner" list in your final message so the
owner can answer them.
